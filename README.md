> **歌詞登録ステータス：同期歌詞あり**

```lrc
[00:13.34] You're striking me down
[00:15.30] With games and lies
[00:17.28] I trusted you but I found
[00:20.54] Your only true friend is your desire
[00:24.99] For playing around
[00:33.99] 
[00:27.13] You're out of your mind
[00:29.08] You've lost control
[00:30.71] I'm gonna take back what's mine
[00:33.56] You'll never have my soul
[00:36.75] This time you have really stepped across the line
[01:01.25] 
[00:42.66] Thieves in a Palace
[00:46.62] Full of tales and lies
[00:50.25] We gotta go in, stake it out
[00:57.33] Expose the malice
[01:00.62] That they chose to hide
[01:04.24] It's just a break in
[01:07.60] To break out
[01:11.50] Breaking in, so we can break out
[01:14.91] Breaking in, so we can break out
[01:18.22] Breaking in, so we can break out
[01:21.83] Breaking out
